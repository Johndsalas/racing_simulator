# Pony Racing Simulator

I wanted to get more practice using python classes, so I made this program. It simulates a race between 6 ponies. I wrote a python class called Pony and used it to create 6 pony objects that were used to store each ponies name, image, x coordinate, y coordinate, and the x coordinate that ends the race. I used random to generate random numbers that would move each pony forward by a differing random value for each game loop. When the ponies finish the race an image of the the place they are in appears beside them  All of the image generation was done using pygame. A menu screen and replay functionality have also been added.
